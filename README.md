# 26-12-2023

This repository is created for giving demo on git and github

Steps I followed for creating this repository:

* Firstly, I created an empty repository named `26-12-2023` in [Github](https://github.com/new).
* Copied the contents from the page titled `create a new repository on the command line` and the lines are
```
echo "# 26-12-2023" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/Praveen-Sidharth/26-12-2023.git
git push -u origin main
```
* I have an empty folder in my file explorer and opened the folder in CMD. After opened CMD, I just copy pasted
and executed the lines one by one.
   * This first line `echo "# 26-12-2023" >> README.md` created a README.md file with the content `"# 26-12-2023"`.
   * This second line `git init` created an empty local git repsitory.
